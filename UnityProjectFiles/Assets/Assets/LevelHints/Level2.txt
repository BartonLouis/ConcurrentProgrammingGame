Now there's 2 of you!

Attacking randomly can work, but is unreliable. To win this level, you'll have to pick your targets, and focus on them until they're dead.

To do this, use if statements to check if your target is still alive.

alive <- IsNotNone enemy
if alive {
	Attack enemy	
} else {
	enemy <- GetEnemyOfType Any
}

Note that when you reach the end of a script, it loops back to the beginning. You can use this to your advantage!
Good Luck!
