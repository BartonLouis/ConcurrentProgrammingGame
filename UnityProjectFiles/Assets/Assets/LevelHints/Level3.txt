You've unlocked a new Character type!
To change a characters class, just click on their icon in the control panel.

Meet the Support hero. They have less health, and deal less damage, but can heal teammates or boost their damage.

Try out the following instructions with your new hero:

	teammate <- GetTeammateOfType Any/Damage/Support
	Heal teammate
	Boost teammate

It's worth knowing now that all characters can heal themselves for a small amount, or defend themselves to block some incoming damage. This can be done with these instructions:

	HealSelf
	DefendSelf

You may need them to keep your support alive!
