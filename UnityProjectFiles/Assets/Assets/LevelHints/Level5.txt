You're heavily outnumbered here!

It's time to learn your most powerful weapon. Charged Moves.
To perform a charged move, a character must draw energy from the resource points either side of them. To do this, use the Lock command to Lock them, like this:

	Lock Left
	Lock Right

Both resources must be locked, and only one character can lock them at a time. Once both resources are locked, a character can charge up, like this:

	Lock Left
	Lock Right
	ChargeUp

Their next operation will be vastly more powerful, attacking an enemy will likely one-shot them, healing a teammate will return them to full HP, etc.

Here's the catch. Locking resources is time-consuming, and there is a risk of deadlock. This is where all characters get stuck waiting for a resource to become available, and eventually get picked off one by one by the enemy.
Your challenge is to write scripts which avoid deadlock, and can kill the enemy team fast enough to avoid defeat!
