This is a big one! Your next new character is the Tank class.

These guys can take a hit! They're good at defending teammates, or blocking enemy attacks, mitigating damage to your team.
They're also good at sending messages, taking less time to communicate to the whole team, making them strong commanders.

The operations available to a Tank are the following:
	
	teammate <- GetTeammateOfType Any/Damage/Support/Tank
	Defend teammate

	enemy <- GetEnemyOfType Any Any/Damage/Support/Tank
	Block enemy

Messaging is key to success. You can coordinate attacks on the same target, or ask for help from teammates.
To Send a message, you need a player reference, whether thats an enemy, a teammate or Self (meaning the character controlled by this script)
You also need a text component, stating what to do with the information in the message. The two are put together like this:

	{ <player>, <text> }

The curly brackets are really important.


You can send a message to one teammate, with:

	SendMessageTo <teammate> <message>

Or, you can send a message to all teammates with:

	SendMessageToAll <message>


To receive a message, a character can use the command:

	message <- Listen

and then read the text and player components with these commands:

	player <- GetPlayerComponent message
	text <- GetTextComponent message

Spend some time getting used to sending messages, and then use them to coordinate your team to better defeat the enemy!
