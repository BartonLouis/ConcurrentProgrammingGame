This is your first enemy! 
Your job is to build an army to defend against them.
To add a character to your army, click on the plus icon on the control bar, then "new script +" to write their instructions for the upcoming battle.

To attack an enemy, you first need a reference to that enemy.
You can achieve this using the line:

enemy <- GetEnemyOfType Any

To Attack that enemy, you can then call the Attack operation, like this:

Attack enemy

Put it all together into one script to defeat your foe!
