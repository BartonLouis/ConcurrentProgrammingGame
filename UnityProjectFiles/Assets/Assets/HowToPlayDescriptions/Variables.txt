Variables are like boxes to store information. For example, a number, a boolean, or more complex information like a Teammate or Enemy.

Variables are created by giving them a name and any piece of information. For example:
	my_variable <- 5
	my_variable <- "Hello World"
	my_variable <- True
	my_variable <- GetEnemyOfType Damage
A variable is assigned by putting a value into it, using the "<-" symbol.
The value on the right can be a literal value, like an integer, a string, a boolean or the result of some Function (See Functions).

The value in a variable can then be read at any time by using the name of the variable. The program then knows to look inside the variable and retrieve the value. For example:
	num1 <- 5
	num2 <- 10
	num3 <- num1 + num2

Note that if you try to read the value inside a variable before is has been created, then it will return None (See None).
