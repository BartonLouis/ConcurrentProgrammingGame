A String Value represents any text. They must be written inside speech marks, like so:
	- "Hello World"

Strings are most helpful for writing messages to other characters (See Messaging):
	text <- "Help Me!"
	teammate <- GetTeammateOfType Support
	SendMessageTo teammate {Self, text}

The receiving character can then read the text and decide what to do:

	# receive message
	message <- Listen
	text <- GetTextComponent message
	player <- GetPlayerComponent message

	# decide what to do
	if text == "Help Me!" {
		Heal player
	} else if text == "Boost Me!"{
		Boost player
	} else if text == "Attack!" {
		Attack player
	}
