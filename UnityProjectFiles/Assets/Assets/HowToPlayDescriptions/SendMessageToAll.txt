	For Tanks:			3, unless there are less than 3 living teammates, in which case the normal rule applies
Parameters:
	- Message: MessageValue
Example Use
	priority_target <- GetEnemyOfType Tank
	SendMessageToAll {priority_target, "Kill Them!"}


Sends a message to all teammates. This can be a very expensive command to run, which is why it should be used sparingly. However, Tank characters have a lower cost for sending message, this makes them good commanders, as they can quickly send commands across the battlefield. (See Messaging for more detail).
