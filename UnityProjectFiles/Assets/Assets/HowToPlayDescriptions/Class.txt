The Class data type represents the different types of classes a character can take. There are 4 values available:
	- Damage
	- Support
	- Tank
	- Any

Damage Character deal more damage, but have very few supporting abilities, they are like the forward spear of your team.
Support Characters have less health, and deal less characters, but they can heal teammates, and boost their damage if they choose to.
Tank Characters have more health, but also deal less damage, they are good at defending teammates, and blocking enemies. As well as this, they have a lower cost for sending messages to teammates, so they make good commanders.
Any represents Any class, this value is most used when getting a character reference without caring which type of character.

Here is an example of their use:
	teammate <- GetTeammateOfType Support
	teammate <- GetTeammateOfType Damage
	teammate <- GetEnemyOfType Tank
	target <- GetEnemyOfType Any
