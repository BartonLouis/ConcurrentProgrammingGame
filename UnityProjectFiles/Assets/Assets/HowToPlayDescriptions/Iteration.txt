Iteration is a way to repeat commands multiple commands based on some condition. For example, attacking an enemy repetitively until they die. Iteration is achieved with the following syntax:
while <boolexpr> {
	<code block>
}

Just like with if-statements, a while-statement firstly evaluates the boolean expression. If it evaluates to True, then it executes the code inside the curly braces, otherwise, it exits the while-statement and carries on with normal execution. If the code inside is executed, then once completed, the character will loop back to the while-statement and evaluate it again. It will keep doing this until it evaluates to False. This introduces a risk of infinite loops, as the statement may always be True.

Here are 2 examples of loops:	
	# Example 1: keeps attacking until the character is dead
	enemy <- GetEnemyOfType Any
	alive <- IsNotNone enemy
	while alive{
		Attack enemy
		alive <- IsNotNone enemy
	}
	
	# Example 2: Boost a teammate 3 times
	teammate <- GetTeammateOfType Damage
	count <- 0
	while count < 3 {
		Boost teammate
		count <- count + 1
	}
