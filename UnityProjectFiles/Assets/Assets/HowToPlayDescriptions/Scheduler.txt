The scheduler is responsible for making sure all characters on the battlefield have a turn running their scripts.

The schedule is made up of multiple 'cores'. Each core can only have one character executing on it at any one time, so if there are 5 cores, then 5 characters can move at once. 

When a character is not executing, it has what's called a 'priority' associated with it. When the scheduler is deciding which character can move next, it checks the priorities of each character. Characters with a higher priority have a higher chance of getting a turn next, but at the end of the day, it's still random and impossible to predict what will happen. Just like on a real computer!

Normally, the priority of each character increases over time at a rate of 1 per turn. So a character who has waited 5 turns will have a priority of 5. However, this can be boosted using the Yield command (See Yield). When a character Yields, it forces the schedule to re-forecast. But when it does so, all characters on the yielding characters team will recieve a boost to their priority equal to the battle YieldBoost (Set in the Skirmish Setup). High YieldBoost makes Yielding very worthwhile for your team, whilst low YieldBoost makes it less impactfull.

Finally, the schedule will also re-forecast when a character dies.
