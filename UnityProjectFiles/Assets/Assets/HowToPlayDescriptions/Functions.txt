A Function is like an operation, except that it has no effect on the state of the battle. A Function is only used for retreiving information about the battle itself. For example, getting an enemy, checking if a character is charged, or checking how much health a character has left. They all return values, which must be stored in a variable using the same notation as before:
	variable_name <- FunctionName <parameter>
