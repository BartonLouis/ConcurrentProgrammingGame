Comments are lines in script which get ignored by the character when running the instructions. They can be helpful for explaining what bits of code do, or keeping code organised. Comments are written with a hashtag '#' followed by the comment. Anything after the hashtag is treated as a comment. Here is an example:
	
	# Section of code to contact a teammate and ask for support
	teammate <- GetTeammateOfType Support
	SendMessageTo teammate {Self, "Help Me!"}

	# Section of code to choose an enemy and attack them until they die
	enemy <- GetEnemyOfType Any
	alive <- IsNotNone enemy
	while alive {
		Attack enemy
		alive <- IsNotNone enemy
	}
